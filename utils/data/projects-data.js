        description: 'I have designed and developed a deep learning-based system for automatic vehicle classification and detection in Bangladesh. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Transfer Learning techniques (such as VGG16, ResNet, or MobileNet) to accurately detect and categorize Bangladeshi vehicles from real-world traffic images. The system is implemented with TensorFlow and Keras for model training and evaluation, and integrated into a web-based dashboard built with NextJS and Tailwind CSS for visualization. The backend API, developed using NestJS and MySQL, manages dataset storage, prediction results, and user interactions. The entire application is deployed on AWS for scalability and performance.',

The model leverages YOLOv8 and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately identify riders and classify helmet usage in real-time from CCTV or traffic camera footage. The system is trained on a custom dataset containing Bangladeshi road images to ensure local accuracy. The implementation uses Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV for model training and testing, and is integrated into a web-based dashboard for monitoring and alert generation.',
